  summary: |
  The Covid19 pandemic has changed a lot and has been dominating our lives for months.
  In addition to the negative consequences, there are also a few very positive ones,
  because the pandemic accelerates the digitalization of our working world.
  I have always been interested in learning new technologies - this together creates a new professional perspective for me.
  Graduated since April 2021 I do various online courses and a webdevelopment-bootcamp to get a lateral entry
  to venture into software development.
